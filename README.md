# Enumerables

About the Project
This is a Solo project about ruby enumerables, recreating the ruby enumerables in my own way to make sure that they do what they do while being used in ruby. 10 are the chosen methods and they are as indicated in the features below: 

### Features
I added my methods in the Enumerable module:

#my_each <br/>
#my_each_with_index<br/>
#my_select <br/>
#my_all? <br/>
#my_any? <br/>
#my_none? <br/>
#my_count <br/>
#my_map - that takse in a block <br/>
#my_inject <br/>
#multiply_els <br/>

## Testing:
### Specs
Passing specs for each of these methods have been with each on them having not less than 2 examples. 
To use the tests, you need to:
 - Have Rspec installed
 - Have some basic knowledge on how to use rspec
 - Have an understanding of TDD
 
 #### Setting up rspec.
  - First check for the availability of rspec on your computer using *rspec -version*. This is should return the version(s) of     rspec you have installed or return an error showing that you do not have rspec installed
  - If you do not have it installed [click here for guidelines and the rest of steps to get you started](https://rspec.info/)
